p My parents had one true passion: reading. I remember being a child, scouring through their hughe bookshelves and secretly taking books back to my room. One of them was #[em &#8220;Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo&#8221;], the story of Christiane F., who became addicted to heroin as a teenager. The book was illustrated with authentic photos and even though I didn&#8217;t know what &#8220;taking drugs&#8221; really meant or what Berlin looked liked, I was fascinated by the story and binge-read the book several times. Now Christiane Felscherinow has published her autobiography about her &#8220;second life&#8221; â€“ the life after Bahnhof Zoo. For #[a(href="http://www.exberliner.com" target="_blank") Exberliner] she answered #[a(href="http://www.waltercrasshole.com" target="_blank") Walter]&#8216;s and my questions.
